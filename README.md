# DnD Map Visualization
Interactive visualization of points of interest on map

## Tools
This project uses Python 3 to convert a large map image to optimized tiles for use in a leaflet map using the GDAL library. The interactive map leverages the Google Charts API, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript to retrieve points of interest from a Google Sheets file and add clickable points.
